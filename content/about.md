Welcome! IÂ´m Miguel, a designer and developer with a passion for creativity and innovation. I took a high-tech course in app development and completed my bachelor's degree in computer science. While finishing my degree, I decided to take a post-graduate program in marketing and business technologies at IPAM, as I believe that knowledge in these areas would enhance my skills and enable me to see things from a different perspective.

Through my education and experience, I have developed a unique skill set that allows me to seamlessly move between creative thinking, design building, and development. As a result, I am able to quickly and efficiently develop any design element while also possessing the technical skills needed to bring them to life.

Completing a post-graduate program in marketing and business technologies has given me an even greater understanding of the industry, from both a business and a futuristic perspective. Overall, I believe that my education and experience have provided me with a well-rounded skill set that allows me to tackle projects from multiple angles and deliver exceptional results.

Feel free to check out my [resume](/cv.pdf) for a more detailed look at my work history and qualifications. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto://zemmsoares@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you!
