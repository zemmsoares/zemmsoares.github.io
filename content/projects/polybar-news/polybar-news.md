Polybar News is an adaptable module created for use with Polybar and i3blocks. It delivers the latest news directly to the user's statusbar, offering a seamless way to stay informed without disrupting workflow. While it comes pre-configured for certain news outlets, its flexible design enables users to easily modify the source of news based on their preferences.
