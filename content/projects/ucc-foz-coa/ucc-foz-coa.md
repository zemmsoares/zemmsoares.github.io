Deeply rooted in the heritage of the Douro Valley,
unifying meaningful symbols into a compelling visual story. The
heart symbol at the core of the design represents our unwaver-
ing commitment to compassionate healthcare. Complement-
ing this is the animal figure, a reflection of the region’s rich
history, drawing inspiration from the local rock art engravings.
These historical elements are delicately balanced with round
shapes, echoing the rolling hills of our vineyards and symbol-
izing our profound bond with nature. These distinct elements
harmoniously intertwine, creating more than just a logo, but a
visual narrative of tradition, nature, and care. Each component
contributes to our brand story, embodying the spirit of the
Douro Valley and reinforcing our commitment to a healthcare
approach that is as much a part of our region’s heritage as it is
a testament to our values..
