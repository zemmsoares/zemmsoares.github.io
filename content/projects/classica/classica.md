Nestled in the heart of Vila Nova de Foz Coa, Classica is a charming stationary and bookstore that has been serving the community for several years. With a wide selection of books, stationery, and office supplies, Classica is the go-to destination for locals and visitors alike.

Recently, Classica underwent a rebranding project to update its visual identity. The project involved creating a modern logo design and branding guidelines that could be used across all platforms, including social media and merchandise. The new visual identity reflects the store's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction while attracting a younger and more diverse audience.
