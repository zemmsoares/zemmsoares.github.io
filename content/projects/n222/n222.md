The N222, or Estrada Nacional 222, is a road that winds its way through some of the most stunning scenery in Portugal. The route spans from Peso da Regua to Pinhao and passes through Vila Nova de Foz Coa, a charming town steeped in history and culture.

The N222 is a popular destination for tourists seeking to explore the Douro Valley's breathtaking landscapes and quaint towns. As the road meanders along the river, visitors are treated to spectacular views of the vineyards that produce some of Portugal's finest wines.

To celebrate the beauty and allure of the N222, we propose a logo that captures the essence of this scenic route. The logo features a winding road that cuts through the hills and vineyards, with the river in the background, symbolizing the journey of discovery visitors can experience while travelling along the N222.
