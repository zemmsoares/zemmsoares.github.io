Nestled within the Coa Valley in Vila Nova de Foz CÃ´a, lies one of the world's most influential rock art sites. The banks of the Coa River boast thousands of man-made engravings dating back to 22,000 to 10,000 B.C., making it the oldest Stone Age art found in Portugal. At Coabicla, we offer bicycle rentals for adventurous travellers to explore Vila Nova de Foz Coa from a unique perspective. Experience the rich history and breathtaking scenery of the Coa Valley as you venture through the area's many biking trails.
