GitoCommito is an innovative extension for Visual Studio Code designed to revolutionize your commit process. By generating commit messages based on your staged changes, it automates a crucial part of your workflow. The extension adheres to the standards set by Conventional Commits, providing a consistent and structured commit history. Furthermore, GitoCommito is powered by OpenAI's language model, enabling it to create meaningful and informative commit messages. The application offers two modes for generating commits - one for quick, simple changes and another for a more detailed and comprehensive approach to capturing multiple changes. Despite being in its initial release, GitoCommito shows promising capabilities and invites users and developers alike to contribute to its continuous improvement.
